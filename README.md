# Security-camera-with-Raspberry-Pi

This is a program built in python3 in conjunction with raspberry pi which,
can be used as a security camera for your house door or in-door.

This is rather a very useful security camera becuase instead of saving any
of the pictures on a memory card, it takes a picture and sends it to your personal email.
Whereever you are in the world, it is extremely easy to access any of the 
pictures that the Pi takes. You can check the picturs on your phone and you can even send
commands to your raspberry pi to take a picture and it will send the picture back to you.

There are 5 files that you need to know about:
1. Main      Where all the functions will be called 
2. Emailing  This will send emails 
3. ReadEmail This will read email and extract the commands 
4. Picture   This will take the picture and save it 
5. P3picam   This detects motion

Any feedback, leave a comment please.

Notice: 
P3picam does NOT belong to me. 
I did NOT write it.
